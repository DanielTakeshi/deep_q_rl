Put human nets here from my other code (in npz format).  Be careful about naming
conventions!

Breakout stuff:

- breakout_nips_model_l1_0.0005_epochs_30_bsize_32.npz (NIPS version)
- breakout_nature_model_l2_0.01_epochs_30_bsize_32.npz (NATURE version, but it
  was actually trained using the NIPS cropping method ... TODO fix!!)

Space Invaders stuff:

- spaceinv_nature_model_l1_0.0005_epochs_30_bsize_32.npz (NATURE version)
